Getting Started with HTML

Question 1. Write a simple program in HTML that displays the heading "HTML define the content and structure of your website" on the web browser?

Answer 1. <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html lang = "en">
          <head>
            <meta charset = "UTF-8">
            <meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width, initial-scale = 1.0">
            <title> HTML Example </title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <h1> HTML defines the content and structure of your website </h1>
          </body>
          </html>


Question 2. Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML documents?

Answer 2. Comments in HTML are used to add notes or information within the code that are not displayed on the web pages. They serve the purpose of 
          providing information for developers or anyone else examining the HTML document. Comments are ignored by browers and don't affect the 
          rendering of the page. To add a comment in HTML, you use the <!-- to start the comment and --> to end it.

          <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html lang = "en">
          <head>
            <meta charset = "UTF-8">
            <meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width, initial-scale = 1.0">
            <title> My Webpage </title>
          </head>
          <body>

          <!--This is a comment. It won't be visible on the webpage -->

            <h1> Welcome to my webpage </h1>
            <p> This is some content on my page </p>

          </body>
          </html>

         In this example, the comment provides additional information to the developer but wont appear when someone views the webpage. Comments are
         useful for explaining the code, making notes, or temporarily disabling parts of the HTML during development.


Question 3. Write an HTML program that includes a heading, a paragraph of text, a horizontal line, and a line break. Arrange these elements to create
            a simple web page layout?

Answer 3. <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html lang = "en">
          <head>
            <meta charset = "UTF-8">
            <meta name = "viewport" content = "width = device-width, initial-scale = 1.0">
            <title> Simple Webpage </title>
          </head>
          <body>

            <h1> Welcome to my simple webpage </h1>

            <p> This is a paragraph of text on my webpage. It can contain information or anything you want to convey </p>

            <hr>

            <p> This is a new paragraph after the horizontal line</p>
            <!--Adding a line break -->
            <br>

            <p> This is an another paragraph with a line break above it</p>

          </body>
          </html>

          This code includes a heading, a paragraph, a horizontal line(<hr>), and a line break(<br>) to create a basic structure


Question 4. Write a short note on Tag and Element with an example?

Answer 4. In HTML, a "Tag" is a fundamental building block used to define elements within a document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets(< and >),
          and they typically come in pairs - an opening tag and a closing tag - with content between them. The opening tag is the beginning of an 
          element, and the closing tag is its end.

          Example of a tag:

          <!-- The <strong> tag is used to define strong importance, usually represented as bold text-->
          <p> This is a <strong>bold</strong> statement.</p>
 
          In this example, <strong> is the opening tag, and </strong> is the closing tag. The content between the tags, "bold", is emphasized and
          typically displayed as bold text on a web page.

          In HTML, an "Element" is a complete unit composed of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Elements area the fundamental building 
          block that define the structure and content of a web page. The opening tag is the beginning of the element, the closing tag is its end, 
          and the content is the information elements between the tags.

          Example of an element:

          <!-- The <h1> element is used to define a top level of heading -->
          <h1> This is a heading</h1>

          In this example, <h1> is the opening tag, and </h1> is the closing tag. "This is a heading" is the content of the <h1> element.


Question 5. What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?

Answer 5. The Document Type Declaration, commonly known as the "DOCTYPE Declaration" or simply "DOCTYPE", is a important element at the beginning 
          of an HTML document. It informs the web browser about the version of HTML used in the document, allowing the browser to render the page 
          correctly. The DOCTYPE Declaration is not an HTML tag, it is a declaration that comes before the <html> tag and it looks like this:

          <!DOCTYPE html>

          In this example, html refers to the version of HTMl being used, and specifically, it indicates the use of the HTML5. HTML5 is the latest 
          and widely adopted version of HTML.
